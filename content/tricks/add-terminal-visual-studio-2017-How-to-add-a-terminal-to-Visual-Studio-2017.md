Visual Studio 2017 lack a proper internal terminal.  The Command Line extension has been a good substitute, but it opens up in a separate window.  If you work with multiple Visual Studio at the same time, you loose track of which command window belongs to which Visual Studio.

Visual Studio Code has it's own Terminal window built-in, so why not Visual Studio itself?  Well, now it is there, a pre-pre tool called Whack Whack (because of how you open it).

You can download the Whack Whack terminal from the Visual Studio marketplace, and the project is open sourced at Github.
