# Exercise 7.1 : Multiple repos locally

Run Exercise-7.1.cmd from a non-git folder


## **DO 1**

Use two instances of gitviz to check the content of the two client repos, the two server repos, and between the client and servers

Notice the way the secondary server repo is added

The exercise introduces bare repositories.  Explain what that is.


## **DO 2**

Connect the first of the client repos to a server, ofc using a different remote name

Create another masterbranch look-alike, so that you dont mix things up

Push it all up

Connect the first of the server repos to a server

Push all up there too

Where can this be useful?


Now add a commit ON THE REMOTE GITHUB site, just add a readme

On the local server repo, try to pull this down.   What and why happened ?

Then fetch. 

Go to the corresponding local repo
