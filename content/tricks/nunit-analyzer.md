# Some useful NUnitAnalyzer information

The NUnit Roslyn Analyzer project is a major part of having a well-functioning NUnit setup.  

It is also part of the `dotnet new nunit` template, the same is being used from Visual Studio when you select to add a new NUnit project.


## Set it up


You can then add the package into the projects of your choosing.  It will then activate and give you both warnings and tools to fix them. 

## NUnit Analyzer Repo

The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers)
