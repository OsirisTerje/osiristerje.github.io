# Pull Requests best practices

Pull-requests are a great way to get changes into your repository, or your production branches, in a controlled manner.

Some think of pull requests as just a new fancy word for Code Reviews, but they are actually way more. A pull request can be automatically checked for code quality, and can be automatically merged into your production branches. Part of this is simply setting policies based on builds, and these can include different types of automatic tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and even performance tests. In addition you can run analysis for code quality, such as static code analysis, and even security analysis.

This is the best way to ensure the code you are merging into your production branches is of the highest quality, and that it is not introducing any new bugs or security issues, and that it follows coding best practices.

What this also does is that it reduce the need for manual code reviews.
A code review should not in any way be a code discussion, but be targeted to the code itself.
In Github there is a separate discussion feature, which is a much better place to discuss coding principles in general.
