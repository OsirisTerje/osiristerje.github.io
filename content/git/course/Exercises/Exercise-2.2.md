# Exercise 2.2  Merging


## A closer look at merging

Use one of your small repos, e.g. the one from Exercise 1.3.

Ensure you have  GitViz open.

Ensure you are on the master branch

* Create a new branch MyTask1  and switch to it

Check that you're actually on the new branch

* Add a file and commit it.

Notice the two branch pointers.

* Go back to master

* Now merge MyTask1 into master

Look at Gitviz again,  what happened ?

Any new merge commits ?

What is this type of merge called ?

When will this type of merge happen versus the other type?

What is the benefit of this type of merging?

What will be the size results of such a merge?
