I am a [Microsoft Visual Studio and Development Technologies MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4025028), Head of the [**NUnit** core development team](https://nunit.org), and a model railroad enthusiast.

My primary focus can best be described as Software Craftsmanship, encompassing the many aspects and disciplines it entails.

I have extensive experience in DevOps (formerly known as ALM) and was first recognized as a Microsoft MVP in 2009 for my contributions in this area. I've since been re-awarded annually for 16 years, now in the Development Technologies category.

While I am deeply code-oriented, I am also a strong advocate for Scrum, Agile, and Lean processes. Ultimately, the truth lies in the code!

I am an ardent supporter of Open Source and firmly believe that both companies and individuals stand to gain significantly. This gain stems not only from the utilization of open-source solutions, which they often do more extensively than they might recognize, but also from active contributions to the open-source community. The impact of such contributions cannot be underestimated; they bring about a profoundly positive transformation in your organizational ethos, fostering a broader global involvement that far surpasses the insularity of keeping one's code proprietary. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with you.

My possible areas of engagement can be divided into four parts:

<strong>Coding and Design</strong>

I am a strong believer in good coding practices, beautiful code, minimalistic coding, pragmatism, strongly typed code, and overall shift-left thinking to everything that relates to coding.  The language of use doesn't really matter, but for myself, I am mostly using C#, dabbles with Python, a bit of C/C++, and otherwise whatever comes my way.  

<strong>Management consulting</strong>

Coaching and mentoring management
Working with the organization, establishing teams and team structures
Establishing best practices for an end-to-end process in an organization, covering from sales through software production, testing and customer feedback.

<strong>Test practices</strong>

I have been working with test teams to improve and change test practices, and in particular in how to automate as much as possible of the testing.
I am advocating that developers embrace in principle a "test-first" (TDD) approach, but stay pragmatic about it. Also that a shift-left practice is often the best, but that it doesn't mean you should not do integration tests. You need both! It is all about the proper balance.

<strong>Architecture, Design and Coding</strong>

I am available for work in the areas of architecture, design (patterns and best practices), coding and testing
- Application and code assessment
- Coaching and mentoring
- Active participation, in particular in critical phases of a project (Yes, I am a coder!)
- Process, including Scrum and DevOps practices, Git source control, and anything related to Github and Azure DevOps.

My main focus areas are Microsoft Technologies, particularly C# based applications, be it client, backend or Azure hosted.
I am also a keen unit testing enthusiast, and as head of the NUnit team, I have a broad knowledge in these areas.
