<p>We have just released a free extension for Visual Studio which adds a Builds Explorer with folders to the Team Explorer.  </p>  <p>The extension can be downloaded from <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/35daa606-4917-43c4-98ab-38632d9dbd45" target="_blank">Visual Studio Gallery</a> or just search for Inmeta in Tools/Extension Manager.</p>  <p>The documentation and issue tracking  can be found at the codeplex site for the project <a title="http://tfsbuildfolders.codeplex.com/" href="http://tfsbuildfolders.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">http://tfsbuildfolders.codeplex.com/</a> and source code is available there.</p>  <p> </p>  <p><a href="http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/terje/Windows-Live-Writer/41a2ef22be6e_C9E/image_2.png"><img style="border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://hermit.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GWB-Windows-Live-Writer-41a2ef22be6e_C9E-image_thumb.png" width="172" height="256" /></a></p>  <p>The Build explorer is based on using a convention of separators in the build definition names.  See <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/04/01/build-folders.aspx" target="_blank">Brian Harry’s blog</a> for  a nice explanation and description of this. </p>  <p>Lars Nilsson who wrote the code base for this extension has <a href="http://larzjoakimnilzzon.blogspot.com/2011/04/inmeta-build-explorer.html" target="_blank">blogged up</a> some of the challenges he faced when implementing this.</p>  <p>The extension have now had 300 downloads in 4 days!  We’ve got very useful feedback, and fixed the issues that came in.  </p>  <ul>   <li>It had problems loading more than 100 builds – now it handles 1000 without any sign of stress.  </li>    <li>Some people noted it had problems when the separator token also existed in the team project name, also fixed. </li>    <li>And some others noted that they couldn’t use a whitespace as a separator!  Something we hadn’t even considered! We fixed that too. </li> </ul>  <p>To us this just shows how useful it is to get community feedback like this.  It is very effective and really appreciated!</p>  <p>If you want to contribute, post us a message at the codeplex site, and we will add you.  There are always possibilities for improvement.  We’ve added a couple of discussions to get some feedback on things that we have seen. </p>  <p>The source has also been posted up there, feel free to use it and do your own stuff based on it.  If you do, we would appreciate a comment back <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://hermit.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GWB-Windows-Live-Writer-Visual-StudioBuild-Folders-extension-for_1391E-wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" />.  Also, if you see issues in the code, tell us, or change it!</p>  <p><strong>Blogs:</strong></p>  <p>Nice blog on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog/Long-list-of-Team-Builds-getting-you-down-Wish-you-could-put-them-in-folders-Dont-want-to-wait-for-a" target="_blank">Coding4Fun  Channel 9</a> by Greg Duncan</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/04/01/build-folders.aspx" target="_blank">Brian Harry has blogged it</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/shair/archive/2011/04/02/build-folders-for-team-explorer.aspx" target="_blank">Shai Raiten has blogged it</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/jakob/archive/2011/04/04/tfs-2010-inmeta-build-explorer.aspx" target="_blank">Jakob Ehn has blogged it</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://larzjoakimnilzzon.blogspot.com/2011/04/inmeta-build-explorer.html" target="_blank">Lars Nilsson has blogged it</a>.</p>
