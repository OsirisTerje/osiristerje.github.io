<p>A new version of the Branching guidance has been released (III), containing very good stuff on how to do branching. It includes labs, sketches and how-to’s. </p>  <p>See <a title="http://tfsbranchingguideiii.codeplex.com/" href="http://tfsbranchingguideiii.codeplex.com/">http://tfsbranchingguideiii.codeplex.com/</a></p>  <p>One of my favorites is the diagram poster shown below which I’ve used to explain the different branching strategies, and I find this very useful and easy to explain.  You’ll find it in one of the tabs of the Visio file included in the download package. </p>  <p>Or you can pick off a lower res image from below:</p>  <p><a href="http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/terje/WindowsLiveWriter/2010BranchingguidancereleasedbytheTFSRan_88A5/image_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://hermit.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-2010BranchingguidancereleasedbytheTFSRan_88A5-image_thumb.png" width="244" height="171" /></a></p>  <p>For most purposes the basic branch plan is more than enough.  I often also see it with only Main and Feature branches, typical for “one of a kind”-type of systems.</p>
