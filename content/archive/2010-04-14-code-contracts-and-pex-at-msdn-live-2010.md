<p>One of the 6 sessions I and Mikael Nitell is running on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/norge/msdn_technet_live/default.aspx">MSDN Live 2010</a> here in Norway is about Code Quality, and part of that session goes through the use of Code Contracts and Pex.  Both fantastic tools ! They can be used together, but are also completely independent from each other, and each can be used single.</p>  <p>Code Contracts  has to downloaded separately from VS 2010 (works also on VS 2008).   Start looking at <a title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx</a> . This download is a free download.   Code Contracts originates form the ideas of <a href="http://bertrandmeyer.com/">Bertrand Meyer</a> – Design by Contract, take a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">here</a>.</p>  <p>Pex is found on the MSDN Subscription download, so it requires an active MSDN Subscription. Start to get it from here <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/downloads.aspx">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/downloads.aspx</a> .  The current version as of 14.4.10 is 0.9, which works with the 2010 RC.  A new version is due this week.  Pex is a tool to generate unit tests, and does this very intelligently.  Perfect to make tests for legacy code, but also to make sure you get all paths tested.  See the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/pex/wiki/reference%20manual.html">Reference information</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/pex/wiki/Creating%20a%20Pex%20Project%20in%20Visual%20Studio.html">project startup information</a>.  </p>  <p>A nice presentation on how Pex and Code Contracts can work together can be found <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/VTL01 ">here</a>. </p>
