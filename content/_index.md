This site (and blog) has recently been moved from WordPress to a Hugo-based site hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/osiristerje/osiristerje.github.io). The new setup is powered by Markdown, allowing for a simpler and more flexible content management process.

Please note that the site is still a work in progress. I'm actively working to refine the design, migrate content, and add new features. Some pages may be incomplete or missing temporarily, so thank you for your patience during this transition.

Feel free to explore and check back often for updates. Your feedback is always welcome!
