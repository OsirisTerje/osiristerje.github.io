<p>Sometimes the tool is blamed for errors which are not the fault of the tool – this is one such story.  It was however, not so easy to get to the bottom of it, so I hope sharing this story can help some others.</p>
<p>One of our test developers started to get this message inside the test steps part of a test case in the MTM.</p>
<p><a href="http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/terje/Windows-Live-Writer/MTM-error-in-displaying-test-steps-cause_EF5A/image_2.png"><img width="576" height="54" title="image" alt="image" border="0" style="border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" src="http://hermit.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GWB-Windows-Live-Writer-MTM-error-in-displaying-test-steps-cause_EF5A-image_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>saying “Could not load file or assembly ‘0 bytes from System, Version=4.0.0.0,……..”</p>
<p>The same error came up inside Visual Studio when we opened a test case there.</p>
<p>Then we noted a similar error on another piece of software – this error:</p>
<p><a href="http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/terje/Windows-Live-Writer/MTM-error-in-displaying-test-steps-cause_EF5A/image_4.png"><img width="561" height="104" title="image" alt="image" border="0" style="border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" src="http://hermit.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GWB-Windows-Live-Writer-MTM-error-in-displaying-test-steps-cause_EF5A-image_thumb_1.png" /></a></p>
<p>A System.BadImageFormatException, and same message as above, but just for framework 2.0.</p>
<p>We found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vistax64.com/net-general/269461-0-bytes-loaded-system.html">this  description</a> which pointed to a malware problem (See bottom of that post), that is a fake anti-spyware program called “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.2-spyware.com/remove-additional-guard.html">Additional Guard</a>”.  We checked the computer in question using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malwarebytes</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=5756">Anti-Malware tool</a>.  It found and cleaned out 753 registry keys!!  After this cleanup operation the error was gone.  This is a great tool ! </p>
<p>The “Additional Guard” program had been inadvertently installed, and then uninstalled afterwards, but the corrupted keys were of course not removed. </p>
<p>We also noted that this computer had full corporate virus scanning and malware protection, but still this nasty little thing still slipped through.</p>
