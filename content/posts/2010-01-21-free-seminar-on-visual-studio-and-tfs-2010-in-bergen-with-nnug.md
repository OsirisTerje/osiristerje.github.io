<p>We’re running a new 2.5 hour seminar on the new Visual Studio 2010 and Team Foundation Server 2010 in Bergen Jan 27th.  See the agenda and invitation at the NNUG site. <a title="http://nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/Moter/NNUG-Bergen---Januar-20092/" href="http://nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/Moter/NNUG-Bergen---Januar-20092/">http://nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/Moter/NNUG-Bergen---Januar-20092/</a></p>  <p>The seminar runs through a typical development cycle, and using demos demonstrates how Team System 2010 can be utilized to cover the whole lifecycle. The focus is on the new features in 2010, and we will try to cover as much ground as possible.  The seminar is nearly power-point free and very developer friendly ! </p>
